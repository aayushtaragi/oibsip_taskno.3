1. Used a custom filter in Excel to identify blank values in the "Name" column and replaced them with "Unknown".

2. Applied the ISTEXT function to detect numeric values in text-based columns like "Host Name" and replaced invalid values with "Unknown". Repeated this process across multiple columns based on their expected data type.

3. Used ISBLANK to check columns like "Last Review" and "Reviews per Month". 
   - Rows where "Last Review" was missing or 0 were removed (since this is a date field).
   - "Reviews per Month" was set to 0 in cases where "Number of Reviews" was 0 or "Last Review" was also missing.

4. Removed any rows with missing or invalid dates.

5. Uploaded the cleaned dataset to Power BI for visualization, even though this step was not part of the original task.
